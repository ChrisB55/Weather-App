##Weather Forecast Single Page App 
This project demonstrates how AngularJS can be used to create single pages applications. It interacts with a free weather service API to return a (generally) accurate forecast for the region requested by the user. It shows the arrangement of controllers, directive, routing and services for an effective single page application. Please download and run on a local host if you'd like to use the unfinished version, or you can wait for the final version.
